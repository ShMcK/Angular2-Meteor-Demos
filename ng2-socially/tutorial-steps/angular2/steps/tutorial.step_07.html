As we are using the ES2015 module loading, Meteor's file loading conventions don't have much effect.

Instead, just keep in mind the power of a few folders:

- client: on the client
- server: on the server
- anywhere else: both

If your app grows in size, you may consider breaking it into smaller parts with these sections included inside. For example:

    parties
      \- client
      \- server
      \- model, etc.
    events
      \- client
      \- server
      \- model, etc

Meteor will combine these together automagically.
