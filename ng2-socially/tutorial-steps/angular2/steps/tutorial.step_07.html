In this article, we'll look at two things:

* Meteor's file structure with Angular 2
* Using TypeScript features

# File Structure

As we are using the ES2015 module loading, Meteor's file loading conventions don't have much effect.

Instead, just keep in mind the power of a few folders:

- client: on the client
- server: on the server
- anywhere else: both

If your app grows in size, you may consider breaking it into smaller parts with these sections included inside. For example:

    parties
      \- client
      \- server
      \- model, etc.
    events
      \- client
      \- server
      \- model, etc

Meteor will combine these together auto-magically.

# TypeScript

Earlier I mentioned that TypeScript has features which make it more powerful than ES2015 alone. We'll look at some of these.

## TypeScript: Types

Types help you find mistakes. For example, we can let the TypeScript compiler know that the `partyId` should be a string, and that routeParams should have the type of RouteParams. If partyId ever returns a number, or array, we know something went wrong right away. It will become highlighted by your IDE or text editor.

Keep in mind, type-checking is not delivered in the outputted JavaScript. It is only extra sugar for your development environment, and adds no weight to the finished product.

    export class PartyDetails {
      partyId: string;
      constructor(@Inject(RouteParams) routeParams:RouteParams) {
        this.partyId = routeParams.params.partyId;
      }
    ...
    }

We don't have time to cover the uses and benefits of types here in detail, but I'd encourage you to [learn more](http://www.typescriptlang.org/).

We'll just gloss over a few benefits quickly.

## TypeScript: Interfaces

Interfaces sound complicated, but I can assure you, they are very simple. They are just groups of types in an object.

We could declare a party as:

    party: {
      name: string;
      description: string;
    }

But that would get repetitive. Instead, we can call it an interface once, and re-use the type. Let's call it IParty, I for interface.

Put IParty in a folder `typings/socially` and call it `socially.d.ts`. Now it can be shared across the app.

__`typings/socially/socially.d.ts`:__

    interface IParty {
      _id?: string;
      name: string;
      description: string;
    }

Note that `_id` is marked as optional, as parties won't get the id until they are passed into a Mongo collection.

We can use IParty to declare some types in our app. For example, in `party-details.ts` I've made several type declarations.

__`client/party-details/party-details.ts`:__

    export class PartyDetails {
      partyId: string;
      resetToParty: IParty;
      party: IParty;
      constructor() {...}

Identifying that both party & resetToParty should have strings for a name and description. Otherwise, the IDE or text editor should let me know something is wrong. Maybe I made a typo.

We can also specify that any declaration of parties is an array of IParty.

__`client/parties-list/parties-list.ts`:__

    export class PartiesList {
      parties: IParty[];
      ...

As well as on the server within Meteor. TypeScript works everywhere.

__`server/loadParties.ts`:__

    var parties:IParty[] = [ ... ]

This all keeps you notified about mistakes or typos. TypeScript's power is seen more and more as your project and team grow.

## TypeScript: Declarations

You may have noticed that Meteor's global variables are being highlighted by your TypeScript checker. Let's fix that.

__`client/party-details/party-details.ts`:__

    declare var Parties;

Declaring items let's TypeScript know that you want it there, and it's not an error.

## TypeScript: Type Definition Files

[TSD](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/tsd) is a package manager for type definition files from [Definitely Typed](http://definitelytyped.org/).

    npm install tsd -g

You can use `tsd query NAME` to search for a specific package NAME. For example:

    tsd query angular2
    > - angular2 / angular2

Let's install type definition files for Angular 2 & Meteor.

    tsd install angular2
    tsd install meteor

These files are loaded into the `typings` directory.

  - client
  - server
  - typings
      \- socially
      \- angular2
      \- es6-promise
      \- meteor
      \- rx

Now we will have the interfaces from these different frameworks.

* Note: The Angular 2 typescript files may not be currently up to date as the API is changing. *

Let's specify that `Parties` is actually a Mongo collection, which will be picked up by TypeScript.

__`client/party-details/party-details.ts`:__

    declare var Parties:Mongo.Collection;

Now if Parties is returning anything other than a valid Mongo Collection, we'll get an error.


## TypeScript: Generics

A generic is a varable that can be passed into an interface. Let's look back at `Parties` again.

    declare var Parties:Mongo.Collection<IParty>;

Now we've told TypeScript that Parties is a Mongo Collection made up of IParty elements.


# Challenge

Add types, interfaces, generics, declarations & type Definition files.

Or not, as mentioned previously, TypeScript features are optional. Without them, you're basically just writing ES2015 code.
